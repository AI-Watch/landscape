# AI TES Dataset 2019

This dataset is the result of a study aimed at mapping the techno-economic segment (TES) of artificial intelligence (AI) from a multidimensional perspective, providing an overview of the worldwide AI landscape in the last decade. The unit of the analysis is the economic agent, or player, that can be a company, university, research institution or governmental authority taking an active role in the segment, with the capability to influence the economic development of the segment and its future evolution. The focus is set on the organisations, and not on individuals, namely the applicant organisation owning the invention in the case of patents, authorsâ€™ affiliation in conference proceedings, companies, governmental entities, etc. This dataset targets both industrial and R&D activities. Therefore, players' economic activities covered include R&D processes (research and innovative developments), general economic processes (industrial production, trade, marketing and other services), firms funding (venture capital funds or other types of investment). The results are provided aggregated by country of location of the institutions concerned.

The dataset contains variables such as number of economic players in the ecosystem active in AI by organisation type (firms, research institutions and government institutions), description of the industry: age, size, sector, relation of business with AI, as well as the AI subdomains in which the geographic areas concentrate.
